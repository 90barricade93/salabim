# Summary

Salabim is a discrete event simulation package in Python.
It uses the process description method as shown in Simula, must, Tomas and SimPy2.
That means processes can be (re)activated, passivated, held, etc. Also resources and
'states' are available.
The integrated 2D-animation makes validation and demonstration simple and powerful.
Salabim supports queueing, sampling from a wide range of statistical distributions, monitoring for further analysis and in detailed tracing.
Simulations and animations run under CPython or PyPy on Windows, Linux, OSX and iOS.

Salabim has applications in transportion research, manufacturing, mining, hospital logistics, network analysis, etc.

Who is behind salabim?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I, Ruud van der Ham, am the sole developer of salabim. I have a long history in simulation, both in 
applications and tool building.

It all started in the mid 70's when modeling container terminals in Prosim, a package
in PL/1 that was inspired by Simula and run on big IBM 360/370 mainframes. |n|
In the eighties, Prosim was ported to smaller computers, but at the same time I
developed a discrete event simulation tool called Must to run on CP/M machines, later
on MSDOS machines, again under PL/1. A bit later, Must was ported to Pascal and was
used in many projects. Must was never ported to Windows. Instead, Hans Veeke (Delft University)
came with Tomas, a package that is still available and runs under Delphi. |n|
End 2016, I wanted an easy to use and open source package for a project, preferably
in Python. Unfortunately, Simpy (particularly version 3) does not support the essential 
process interaction methods activate, hold, passivate and standby. First I tried to 
build a wrapper around Simpy 3, but that didn't work too well.

That was the start of a new package, called salabim.
One of the key features of salabim is the powerful animation engine that is heavily
inspired by some more creative projects where every animation object can change position,
shape, colour, orientation over time. Although rarely used in normal simulation models,
all that functionality is available in salabim. |n|
Over the year 2017, a lot of functionality was added as well bugs were fixed. During that year
the package became available on PyPI and GitHub and the documentation was made available. |n|
Large parts of salabim were actually developed on an iPad on the excellent Pythonista platform. The full
functionality is thus available under iOS as well.

Why is the package called salabim?  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: python

    s = 'sim ulation'
    print(s)
    s = s[:4]
    print(s)
    s += 'salabim'
    print(s)
    s = ' ' * 4 + s[4:]
    print(s)

.. code-block:: none

    sim ulation
    sim
    sim salabim
        salabim

Modeling
--------
A simple model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's start with a very simple model, to demonstrate the basic structure,
process interaction, component definition and output:

.. literalinclude:: ..\..\Example - basic.py
    :linenos:
   
In basic steps:
   
We always start by importing salabim ::

   import salabim as sim

Now we can refer to all salabim classes and function with ``sim.``.
For convenience, some functions or classes can be imported with, for instance ::

   from salabim import now, main, Component

It is also possible to import all methods, classes and globals by ::

   from salabim import *
   
, but we do not recommend that method.

The main body of every salabim model usually starts with ::

   env = sim.Environment(parameters)
   
For each (active) component we define a class as in ::

   class Car(sim.Component):

The class inherits from sim.Component.

Although it is possible to define other processes within a class,
the standard way is to define a generator function called ``process`` in the class.
A generator is a function with at least one yield statement. These are used in salabim context as
a signal to give control to the sequence mechanism.

In this example, ::

   yield self.hold(1)

gives control,to the sequence mechanism and *comes back* after 1 time unit. The self. part means that
it is this component to be held for some time. We will see later other uses of yield like passivate,
request, wait and standby.

In the main body an instance of a car is created by Car(). It automatically gets the name car.0.
As there is a generator function called
process in Car, this process description will be activated (by default at time now, which is 0 here).
It is possible to start a process later, but this is by far the most common way to start a process.

With ::

   env.run(till=5)

we start the simulation and get back control after 5 time units. A component called *main* is defined
under the hood to get access to the main process.

When we run this program, we get the following output

.. code-block:: none

    line#         time current component    action                               information

A bank example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now let's move to a more realistic model. Here customers are arriving in
a bank, where there is one clerk. This clerk handles the
customers in first in first out (FIFO) order.
We see the following processes:

- The customer generator that creates the customers, with an inter arrival time of uniform(5,15)
- The customers
- The clerk, which serves the customers in a constant time of 30 (overloaded and non steady state system)

And we need a queue for the customers to wait for service.

The model code is:

.. literalinclude:: ..\..\Example - bank, 1 clerk.py
    :linenos:
    
Let's look at some details ::

   yield self.hold(sim.Uniform(5, 15).sample())

will do the statistical sampling and wait for that time till the next customer is created.

With ::

   self.enter(waitingline)

the customer places itself at the tail of the waiting line.

Then, the customer checks whether the clerk is idle, and if so, activates him immediately. ::

    while clerk.ispassive():
        clerk.activate()
        
Once the clerk is active (again), it gets the first customer out of the waitingline with ::
    
    self.customer = waitingline.pop()
    
and holds for 30 time units with ::

    yield self.hold(30)

After that hold the customer is activated and will terminate ::

    self.customer.activate()

In the main section of the program, we create the CustomerGenerator, the Clerk and a queue called waitingline.
After the simulation is finished, the statistics of the queue are presented with ::

    waitingline.print_statistics()

The output looks like

.. code-block:: none

    line#         time current component    action                               information

Now, let's add more clerks. Here we have chosen to put the three clerks in a list ::

    clerks = [Clerk() for _ in range(3)]

although in this case we could have also put them in a salabim queue, like ::

    clerks = sim.Queue('clerks')
    for _ in range(3):
        Clerk().enter(clerks)

And, to restart a clerk ::

    for clerk in clerks:
        if clerk.ispassive():
           clerk.activate()
           break  # reactivate only one clerk
        
The complete source of a three clerk post office:

.. literalinclude:: ..\..\Example - bank, 3 clerks.py
    
A bank office example with resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The salabim package contains another useful concept for modelling: resources.
Resources have a limited capacity and can be claimed by components and released later. 

In the model of the bank with the same functionality as the above example, the 
clerks are defined as a resource with capacity 3.

The model code is:

.. literalinclude:: ..\..\Example - bank, 3 clerks (resources).py

Let's look at some details. ::

   clerks = sim.Resource('clerks', capacity=3)
   
This defines a resource with a capacity of 3.

And then, a customer, just tries to claim one unit (=clerk) from the resource with ::

    yield self.request(clerks)
    
Here, we use the default of 1 unit. If the resource is not available, the customer just
waits for it to become available (in order of arrival).

In contrast with the previous example, the customer now holds itself for 10 time units.

And after these 10 time units, the customer releases the resource with ::

    self.release()
    
The effect is that salabim then tries to honor the next pending request, if any.

The statistics are maintained in a system queue, called clerk.requesters().

The output is very similar to the earlier example. The statistics are exactly the same.

The bank office example with balking and reneging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now, we assume that clients are not going to the queue when there are more than 5 clients
waiting (balking). On top of that, if a client is waiting longer than 50, he/she will
leave as well (reneging).

The model code is:

.. literalinclude:: ..\..\Example - bank, 3 clerks, reneging.py

Let's look at some details. ::

   yield self.cancel()
   
This makes the current component (a customer) a data component (and be subject to 
garbage collection), if the queue length is 5 or more.

The reneging is implemented by a hold of 50. If a clerk can service a customer, it will take
the customer out of the waitingline and will activate it at that moment. The customer just has to check
whether he/she is still in the waiting line. If so, he/she has been serviced in time and thus will renege. ::

   yield self.hold(50)
   if self in waitingline:
       self.leave(waitingline)
       env.number_reneged += 1
   else:
        self.passivate()
        
All the clerk has to do when starting servicing a client is to get the next customer in line 
out of the queue (as before) and activate this customer (at time now). The effect is that the hold
of the customer will end. ::

   self.customer = waitingline.pop()
   self.customer.activate()
   
The bank office example with balking and reneging (resources)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now we show how the balking and reneging is implemented with resources.
   
The model code is:

.. literalinclude:: ..\..\Example - bank, 3 clerks, reneging (resources).py

As you can see, the balking part is exactly the same as in the example without resources.

For the renenging, all we have to do is add a fail_delay ::

   yield self.request(clerks, fail_delay=50)

If the request is not honored within 50 time units, the process continues after that request statement.
And then, we just check whether the request has failed ::

   if self.failed():
       env.number_reneged += 1
       
This example shows clearly the advantage of the resource solution over the passivate/activate method, in this example.
  
The bank office example with states
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The salabim package contains yet another useful concept for modelling: states.
In this case, we define a state called worktodo.

The model code is:

.. literalinclude:: ..\..\Example - bank, 3 clerks (state).py

Let's look at some details. ::

   worktodo = sim.State('worktodo')
   
This defines a state with an initial value False.

In the code of the customer, the customer tries to trigger one clerk with ::

   worktodo.trigger(max=1)

The effect is that if there are clerks waiting for worktodo, the first clerk's wait is honored and
that clerk continues its process after ::

   yield self.wait(worktodo)
   
Note that the clerk is only going to wait for worktodo after completion of a job if there
are no customers waiting.

The bank office example with standby
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The salabim package contains a powerful process mechanism, called standby. When a component
is in standby mode, it will become current after each event. Normally, the standby will be
used in a while loop where at every event a condition is checked.

The model with standby is ::

.. literalinclude:: ..\..\Example - bank, 3 clerks (standby.py)

In this case, the condition is checked frequently with ::

    while len(waitingline) == 0:
        yield self.standby()

The rest of the code is very similar to the version with states.

.. warning ::

    It is very important to realize that this mechanism can have significant impact on the performance,
    as after EACH event, the component becomes current and has to be checked.
    In general it is recommended to try and use states or a more straightforward passivate/activate
    construction.

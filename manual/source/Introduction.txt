Introduction
------------

Salabim is a package for discrete event simulation in Python.
It follows the methodology of process description as originally demonstrated in *Simula*
and later in *Prosim*, *Must* and *Tomas*. |n|
The process interaction methods are also quite similar to *SimPy 2*.  

The package comprises discrete event simulation, queue handling, resources, statistical sampling and monitoring.
On top of that real time animation is built in. 

The package comes with a number of sample models.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Salabim runs on

* CPython
* PyPy platform
* Pythonista (iOS)

The package runs under Python 2.7 or 3.x.

The following packages are required:

=============== ================== ================== ================== ================ 
Platform        Base functionality Animation          Video (mp4, avi)   Animated GIF    
=============== ================== ================== ================== ================
CPython         -                  Pillow, tkinter    opencv, numpy      Pillow
PyPy            -                  Pillow, tkinter    N/A                Pillow
Pythonista      -                  Pillow             N/A                Pillow
=============== ================== ================== ================== ================ 

Several CPython packages, like *WinPython* support Pillow out of the box. If not, install with:
    ``pip install Pillow``

Under Linux, Pillow can be installed with: 
    ``sudo apt-get purge python3-pil`` |n|
    ``sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk``

For, video production, installation of opencv and numpy may be required with
    ``pip install opencv-python`` |n|
    ``pip install numpy``
    
Running models under PyPy is highly recommended for production runs,
where run time is important. We have found 6 to 7 times faster execution compared to CPython.
However, for development, nothing can beat CPython or Pythonista.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The preferred way to install salabim is from PyPI with:
  ``pip install salabim``
or to upgrade to a new version:
  ``pip install salabim --upgrade``

You can find the package along with some support files and sample models on www.github.com/salabim/salabim.
From there you can directly download as a zip file and next extract all files.
Alternatively the repository can be cloned.|n|

For Pythonista, the easiest way to download salabim is:

* Tap 'Open in...'.
* Tap 'Run Pythonista Script'.
* Pick this script and tap the run button
* Import file
* Possibly after short delay, there will be a salabim-master.zip file in the root directory
* Tap this zip file and Extract files
* All files are now in a directory called salabim-master
* Optionally rename this directory to salabim

Salabim itself is provided as one Python script, called salabim.py.
You may place that file in any directory where your models reside. |n|

If you want salabim to be available from other directories, without copying the salabim.py script,
run the supplied install.py file.
In doing so, you will create (or update) a salabim directory in the site-package directory,
which will contain a copy of the salabim package.


Python
^^^^^^
Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming,
created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design
philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to
delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers
to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages
such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs
on both a small and large scale.
